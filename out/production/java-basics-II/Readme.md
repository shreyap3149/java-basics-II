# Java Basics II

## Instructions:

1. Fork and clone this repository.

2. Open your Java Basics II Unit. Most of the readings contain a "Try it yourself".

3. Create a folder named `src`. You will upload your code to each module (not UML) in the folder named `src`.

For example, the `OOP: Inheritance` module asks you to create a `Cat` class and consume it. So you can set up your file structure like this:

```
src
|
+--- Inheritance
     |
     +--- Cat.java
     +--- Main.java
```

4. Once done with all 5 modules, push up your work to YOUR FORK.
